We copied the base code from this repo https://github.com/acmerobotics/road-runner-quickstart. It goes without saying that we are not the original creators of the code, as we are merely improving upon it and using it for our needs. The awesome team behind the base code is ACME Robotics 8367, so special thanks to them!
